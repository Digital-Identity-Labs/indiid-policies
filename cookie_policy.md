# Cookie Policy

## What are cookies?

Cookies are small text files stored in your web browser. A website can ask your web browser to remember a cookie, and then send the cookie back whenever you view a page on that website. 

They improve things by:

* Remembering settings, so you don’t have to keep re-entering them whenever you visit a new page
* Remembering information you’ve given (eg your postcode) so you don’t need to keep entering it
* Measuring how you use the website so we can make sure it meets your needs

You can view, manage and delete these small files using your web browser's settings whenever you want. It is possible to turn off all cookies, or decide which websites can use them.

This page describes how Indiid.net uses cookies, and what each cookie contains. Cookies are very important for Indiid.net - it is impossible to log in to Indiid.net without cookies.

### Indiid Session Cookies
A 'session' is a temporary record of whether you have logged in and how you are currently using Indiid.net. Your session information is stored on the Indiid.net servers, but to match your web browser to your session, we store a unique number for your session in a cookie. Indiid.net is made up of a different applications, so each has it's own session and session cookie.
