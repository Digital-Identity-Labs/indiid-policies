Indiid Policies
===============

Open terms and policies for Indiid.net.

## What is this?

The legal aspects of setting up a web-based business are awkward. We want Indiid to be a good service to use and to be fair, but we also want to run a sustainable business that doesn't get destroyed by malicious litigation or abusive users.

Most of Indiid.net is not yet Open Source but it seems like a good idea to open our terms and policies straight away. Github will keep track of all revisions over time and handle suggestions. We'll consider pull-requests.

## Terms, Warranty, etc.

Yes, there are terms for our terms: We're not making any claims that these documents are fit for purpose at all. 

These documents are a work-in-progress and may not be the current terms actually in use at Indiid.net.

Cutting privacy polices down to a few simple icons is a great idea. We're going to use icons from Privacy Simplified.
